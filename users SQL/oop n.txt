polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are the same type of objects.it's a great way to write more flexible and reusable code.  


Let's say you have a program that needs to process several different types of shapes, like circles, squares, and triangles. 
You could define a Shape class with a method called "calculateArea", and then define separate Circle, Square, and Triangle classes that inherit from the Shape class and implement their own versions of the "calculateArea" method.
 Then, you could create an array of Shape objects, fill it with instances of each of the different shape classes, and call the "calculateArea" method on each of them.
 This way, you can treat all of the different shapes as if they are just Shapes, even though they are actually differentÂ classes!
